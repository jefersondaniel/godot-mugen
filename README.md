# Godot Mugen

[M.U.G.E.Nâ„¢](https://www.elecbyte.com/mugendocs-11b1/mugen.html) clone using the Godot engine. This project aims to be compatible with HTML5 exports, utilizing GDScript for the majority of the game logic and Rust for native modules.

# Project Status

This project is an implementation of a basic Mugen clone using the Godot engine. It is still in early development and is not yet fully compatible. I am not actively working on this project, but I am open to contributions. Additionally, I have created a Proof of Concept (POC) using a different architecture based on ECS and Rust, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jefersondaniel/gdnative-rust-poc).

## Requirements

* Godot 3.5
* Clang
* Rust

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

unzip mugen-data.zip && rm mugen-data.zip
```

3. Compile custom GDNative modules

```sh
cd source/native
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
